### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase project credentials:
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Supabase Auth Rate Limiting
If you encounter an error message like **"For security purposes, you can only request this after X seconds"** when trying to sign up or request a password reset, this is a standard security feature from Supabase to prevent spam and abuse.

**Solution:** Please wait for the specified time (usually about a minute) before trying the action again. This is expected behavior during development if you make multiple auth requests in a short period.
